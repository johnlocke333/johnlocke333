## Hi there! My Name is Jack Locke! ðŸ‘‹

Aspiring Data Scientist with experience in data acquisition and data modeling, statistical analysis, machine learning, deep learning, and Tableau. With a background in medical claims/records, I possess the ability to handle multiple projects simultaneously, utilizing strong communication skills to facilitate group collaboration and presenting to a non-technical audience.
